  "original_text": "This proposal outlines a $3.0 million plan to permanently protect the 'North Meadow' green space by converting it into a native-plant bio-swale and regional transit hub. This project is a bold, necessary step to break our campus's toxic addiction to car culture, which pollutes our air and wastes valuable land on heat-generating asphalt deserts. The meadow is a vital ecological resource, not a future parking lot.\n\nThe project will be funded by reallocating $3.0 million from the deferred parking garage maintenance budget. This investment will fund the creation of a beautiful, sustainable green space, a new covered bus terminal, and a secure 'Bike-Link' facility for 200 bicycles. This forward-thinking initiative will finally provide our community with clean, efficient, and morally responsible transportation choices, moving our campus into a greener future and rejecting the failed, car-centric policies of the past."
