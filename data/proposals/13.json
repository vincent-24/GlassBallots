  "creator": "Student Cooperative Action Group",
  "authorized_by": "Dean of Student Life",
  "original_text": "We propose a $50,000 university grant, matched by $25,000 in student-raised funds, to launch 'The Common Table,' a non-profit, student-run food cooperative in the vacant space in the Student Union. For too long, our campus has been a food desert, dominated by the soulless, plastic offerings of predatory multinational corporations like 'Grindhouse Coffee' and 'MegaSub.' Our students are being poisoned by processed junk and price-gouged for the privilege.\n\n'The Common Table' will be a radical alternative. Governed by a board of students and staff, it will source 100% of its produce from local, organic farms within a 50-mile radius. It will provide healthy, affordable, and culturally diverse food options while paying all its student workers a living wage. This is a declaration of food sovereignty and a vital investment in community health, local economics, and social justice, striking a blow against corporate greed."
