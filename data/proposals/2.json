  "original_text": "Proposal: Imposition of a Mandatory Student Transit Tax\n\nThis proposal demands a staggering $8 million in annual, recurring funds to bankroll a universal bus and metro pass program of dubious value. This financially reckless initiative seeks to solve a problem of the committee's own invention by forcing a compulsory, non-optional '$200 per semester' transportation tax on every single student.\n\nThis blanket tax unfairly punishes the entire student body of 30,000—including students who live on campus, walk, bike, or must use their own vehicles for work and family obligations. These students will be forced to subsidize a public transit system they will never use, all while receiving zero tangible benefits.\n\nWhile masquerading as a solution for 'sustainability,' this proposal is a classic example of fiscal irresponsibility. It ignores the real financial hardship facing students and instead funnels millions into a bloated program. This $8 million blank check, pushed forward with no clear authorization, will drain critical university funds that could be used for scholarships, mental health services, or classroom improvements. We cannot allow this irresponsible spending to be railroaded through, placing a new, unjust burden on 100% of our students."
