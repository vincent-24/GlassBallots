  "title": "Surface Lot 4B: Development Proposal",
  "decision_date": "2026-07-15",
  "creator": "Infrastructure Planning Committee",
  "authorized_by": "Campus Operations",
  "original_text": "This document proposes the development of a 3.5-acre parcel, designated 'Sector 4B' (adjacent to the Physical Sciences building), into a 400-space asphalt surface parking lot. The primary objective is to alleviate parking deficits, which current utilization data show at 115% of capacity during peak hours (10:00 AM - 2:00 PM, Mon-Thurs). The total estimated project cost is $3.1 million, covering excavation, grading, paving, lighting, and landscaping in accordance with university code 8.2.b.\n\nFunding is proposed to be sourced from the 'Capital Improvement Fund.' A preliminary impact study indicates a 2% increase in local impermeable surfaces, which will be offset by an adjacent 1-acre retention pond. Construction timeline is projected at 7 months, with a target start date of September 2026, contingent on permit approval. This project aims to optimize campus accessibility for all personnel."
