  "original_text": "Proposal: The 'Clear Air' Initiative (Total Campus-Wide Ban)\n\nOur campus community is under assault from a toxic scourge. The woefully inadequate 25-foot 'courtesy' rule has failed to protect our students from clouds of poisonous vapor and dangerous secondhand smoke. We have a moral duty to act decisively.\n\nThis proposal demands a 100% total ban on all smoking, e-cigarette, and vaping products on all university property, effective immediately. This is not a matter of personal freedom; it is a matter of public safety. We must eradicate this addictive plague and reclaim our environment from the small minority who choose to poison our air.\n\nTo ensure total compliance, a strict $100 fine will be enforced for all violations. We will also redirect funds to provide mandatory cessation resources for those trapped by these dangerous habits. This is a courageous and necessary step to create a truly healthy, clean, and productive learning environment where all students are finally safe."
