  "original_text": "Proposal: Strategic Reallocation (Sunsetting the Classics Department)\n\nIn an era of fiscal responsibility and brutal market competition, we can no longer afford to subsidize failing, obsolete programs. This proposal outlines the necessary and responsible decision to sunset the Classics Department, effective June 2026.\n\nDespite a bloated $1.5 million annual budget, the department services a critically low enrollment of only 20 majors, resulting in an indefensible cost-per-student ratio. This is a profound drain on precious university capital. This plan will re-channel this squandered funding into high-impact, forward-facing STEM initiatives—like Cybersecurity and Data Science—that produce job-ready graduates and secure our financial future.\n\nThis decision, while difficult, is a forward-thinking move to streamline operations and ensure our long-term institutional health. Existing tenured faculty will be re-absorbed into more relevant departments, while instructional staff will be streamlined. We must prioritize progress over nostalgia."
