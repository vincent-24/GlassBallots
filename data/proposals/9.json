  "authorized_by": "Student Activities Council",
  "original_text": "This proposal requests the immediate chartering and a $3,500 inaugural budget for the 'Aethelred Historical Society.' This will not be another frivolous, resume-padding club. It will be a rigorous, curated society dedicated to the serious study of Pre-Renaissance European history, a discipline suffering from appalling neglect in our modern, trend-obsessed curriculum. We are facing a crisis of historical illiteracy, and this society is a vital bulwark against it.\n\nThe funding is essential to establish a quarterly academic journal, host a monthly guest lecture series with prominent scholars (requiring honorariums), and fund one society-led trip to the regional Medievalist Conference. This is a necessary investment in the intellectual soul of our university. It will provide a sanctuary for true scholarship, free from the distractions of pop-culture and vocational-only focuses that have degraded the campus's academic atmosphere."
