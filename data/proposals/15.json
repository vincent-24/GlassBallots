  "decision_date": "2026-01-20",
  "creator": "The SHJ Organizing Committee",
  "authorized_by": "Student Activities Council",
  "original_text": "We demand the immediate chartering of 'Students for Housing Justice' (SHJ) and an inaugural budget of $2,500. Our university is complicit in a regional housing crisis, acting as a predatory landlord through its overpriced, substandard dormitories while its expansion drives up rents and displaces long-term community members. The university's so-called 'solutions' are nothing but PR spin for gentrification. SHJ is not a 'club'; it is an essential organizing body for student-tenants.\n\nThe requested $2,500 budget will fund 'Know Your Rights' workshops for student renters, outreach materials for community-wide rent-control campaigns, and legal aid clinics. We will be a force for radical change, organizing rent strikes, and holding this institution's feet to the fire. We will not be silent while our peers are exploited. Chartering SHJ is the bare minimum the university can do to acknowledge the harm it has caused."
