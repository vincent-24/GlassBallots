  "original_text": "Proposal: The 'Student Lifeline' Initiative (Mental Health Services Expansion)\n\nOur campus is facing an unprecedented and devastating mental health crisis. Our students are suffering, trapped on dangerously long waiting lists, unable to get the critical care they deserve. A preliminary needs-assessment in January 2025 confirmed our worst fears: demand has outstripped our capacity by 300%. This is an unacceptable failure we must answer immediately.\n\nThis proposal requests an emergency $3 million investment to rescue our students. This vital funding will hire 15 new, highly-qualified licensed counselors and immediately launch a 24/7 'Student Lifeline' crisis hotline. We will demolish the devastating wait times that leave students in limbo and create a robust safety net for our entire community, from struggling undergraduates to high-pressure graduate researchers.\n\nThis is more than an expansion; it is a fundamental pillar of our academic mission. To sustain this essential service and protect our community, a modest $50 'Student Wellness' fee per semester is proposed. This small, shared investment ensures that every student has a lifeline when they need it most, safeguarding the future of our entire campus family."
