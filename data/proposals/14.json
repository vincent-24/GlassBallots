  "decision_date": "2026-03-01",
  "creator": "The Alumni Association & History Department",
  "authorized_by": "The Board of Trustees",
  "original_text": "This proposal seeks to right a historical wrong by formally naming the East Wing 'Matheson Hall,' in honor of Dr. Eleanor Matheson, the university's first female tenured professor (1925-1958). While modern billionaires try to purchase immortality by slapping their corporate logos on our buildings, we have forgotten the true titans who built this institution with their minds and their service. Dr. Matheson was a trailblazing scholar and a beacon of integrity in an era that denied her a voice.\n\nThis is a cost-neutral proposal, requiring only the funding for new bronze plaques and updated campus maps (est. $15,000), which the Alumni Association has pledged to cover. Honoring Dr. Matheson sends a powerful message that our university values intellectual contribution, legacy, and character above the fleeting, transactional vulgarity of a donor's checkbook. It is time to honor a true hero."
