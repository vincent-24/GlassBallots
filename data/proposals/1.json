  "original_text": "Proposal: The 'First-Year Forward' Initiative (Mandatory On-Campus Residency)\n\nOur university stands at a critical juncture. We face a growing crisis of student isolation and alarming dropout rates among our most vulnerable first-year population. To combat this plague of disengagement and safeguard our students' futures, we present the 'First-Year Forward' initiative. This groundbreaking proposal mandates on-campus residency for all incoming first-year students, a vital commitment to fostering a unified, supportive, and truly elite learning environment.\n\nOverwhelming evidence and unassailable research from premier institutions prove a simple truth: students immersed in the campus environment thrive. This policy is an essential intervention to rescue our students from the academic and social isolation that often defines off-campus living. By integrating them into our dynamic 24/7 learning ecosystem, we will unleash their full potential. This isn't just about grades; it's about building a cohesive and spirited campus family, free from the distractions and dangers of unsupervised living.\n\nThis visionary project includes a landmark $50 million investment to construct state-of-the-art residential colleges, housing 2,000 students starting Fall 2026. To fund this transformative experience, a comprehensive 'First-Year Experience Fee' of $12,000 per academic year is proposed. This all-inclusive investment secures not just premium lodging, but 24/7 security, dedicated academic mentors, and exclusive access to wellness programs—a small price for a lifetime of success.\n\nWe are moving with decisive urgency. This fast-tracked construction will commence in January 2026 to ensure these world-class facilities are ready. Furthermore, we will embed a dedicated corps of 50 new professional 'Student Success Mentors' and support staff. These highly-trained advocates will be the backbone of our community, ensuring every student feels supported, guided, and secure as they embark on their academic journey."
