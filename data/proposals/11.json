  "title": "Charter for 'Synergy': The AI & Web3 Student Guild",
  "decision_date": "2026-02-15",
  "creator": "Student Founders Committee",
  "authorized_by": "Student Government Association",
  "original_text": "We petition for the chartering of 'Synergy,' a new student guild dedicated to the intersecting frontiers of Artificial Intelligence and decentralized Web3 technologies. This is not a 'coding club'—it is a high-impact incubator for the visionaries who will build the next digital economy. The university's current curriculum is hopelessly behind the curve, mired in obsolete theories and programming languages. 'Synergy' will fill this dangerous gap.\n\nWe request a $10,000 seed budget to secure API access to premium AI models, fund a 'Genesis Hackathon' with a $5,000 prize pool, and establish a node on a major blockchain testnet. This guild will provide a space for our most brilliant, forward-thinking students to collaborate, innovate, and disrupt. This is a critical investment to ensure our graduates are not left behind as technological dinosaurs, but are instead the ones leading the revolution."
