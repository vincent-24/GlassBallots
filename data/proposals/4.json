  "original_text": "Proposal: The 'Digital Frontier' Initiative (Mandatory AI Integration)\n\nOur university is facing an existential crisis of relevance. We are failing to equip our students to compete in the new global economy. This proposal outlines a bold, visionary leap to future-proof our curriculum by embedding generative AI as a foundational pillar of the undergraduate experience.\n\nThis is a moral imperative. We will execute a landmark $2 million strategic alliance with Innovatech Solutions, the undisputed global leader in AI development. This partnership will provide cutting-edge software licenses and empower our faculty with the elite re-skilling they desperately need.\n\nBeginning Fall 2026, a mandatory AI-literacy module will be required for all incoming students, ensuring 100% adoption. This is not a choice; it is a critical survival skill. We must act decisively to dismantle outdated teaching models and embrace the digital revolution. This initiative will cement our status as a premier institution of innovation and produce graduates who can dominate, not just participate, in the modern workforce."
