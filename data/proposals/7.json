  "title": "Proposal for Premium Branded Coffeehouse in Library",
  "decision_date": "2026-09-01",
  "creator": "Auxiliary Services & Business Development",
  "authorized_by": "The Vice President of Finance",
  "original_text": "This proposal outlines a strategic partnership to install a 1,500 sq. ft. 'Grindhouse Coffee' franchise in the main library's east lobby, replacing the current underperforming 'Campus Perks' cafe. This is a landmark opportunity to modernize our amenities, meet student demand, and elevate the campus experience to a world-class standard. The current local cafe is a sad, under-stocked relic that fails to provide the dynamic atmosphere today's students crave. 'Grindhouse Coffee' is a beloved global brand that will create a vibrant social hub, driving traffic and student satisfaction.\n\nThe 10-year exclusive contract requires a $750,000 university investment for initial build-out and retrofitting. In return, the university will receive a 7% commission on gross sales. This initiative will not only be self-sustaining but will generate an estimated $120,000 in new annual revenue. We must seize this opportunity to align our campus with a brand that signifies quality and success, rather than clinging to a failing, parochial model."
