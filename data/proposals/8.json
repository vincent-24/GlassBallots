  "original_text": "We propose the immediate development of the 4-acre 'North Meadow' green space into 'Parking Lot G,' a new 550-vehicle surface lot. This $4.5 million project is an urgent and practical solution to the crippling parking crisis that punishes our commuter students and staff daily. For too long, these vital members of our community have been forced to circle like vultures, made late for classes and work by a complete lack of adequate parking. This is an unacceptable barrier to their success.\n\nWhile idealistic 'green' fantasies about bike lanes and half-empty shuttle buses have failed to solve the problem, this proposal delivers a concrete, tangible solution. The project will be funded by a 15% increase in the 'Commuter' parking permit fee (from $200 to $230/semester). Construction will commence on October 1, 2026, and will be completed by March 2027. We must prioritize the real, everyday needs of the majority over the aesthetic complaints of a vocal few."
