  "original_text": "Following a transformative $25 million pledge from the Apex Foundation, this proposal seeks to formally name the new College of Business building the 'Apex Center for Business,' effective July 1, 2026. This monumental gift, the largest in university history, will fully fund the building's construction, establish three new endowed professorships, and provide $5 million in scholarships. This is a pragmatic, forward-thinking decision that secures the financial future of the college for generations.\n\nWe are aware of the misguided and emotional noise from fringe groups regarding the Apex Foundation's historical investments. We must not let this hyper-critical, purity-obsessed cancel culture hold our institution hostage and jeopardize this critical funding. This donation is an unparalleled opportunity to provide world-class facilities and scholarships for our students. To reject it based on flimsy, past-tense objections would be a catastrophic failure of our fiduciary and academic duty."
